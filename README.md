# A Primer on Gaussian Processes for Regression Analysis 

**PyData NYC 2019**

## Description

Gaussian processes are flexible probabilistic models that can be used to perform Bayesian regression analysis without having to provide pre-specified functional relationships between the variables. This tutorial will introduce new users to specifying, fitting and validating Gaussian process models in Python.

## Abstract

Nowadays, there are many ways of building data science models using Python, including statistical and machine learning methods. I will introduce probabilistic models, which use Bayesian statistical methods to quantify all aspects of uncertainty relevant to your problem, and provide inferences in simple, interpretable terms using probabilities. A particularly flexible class of probabilistic models uses Bayesian non-parametric methods, which allow models to vary in complexity depending on how much data are available. In doing so, they avoid the over-fitting that is common in machine learning and statistical modeling. I will demonstrate the basics of Bayesian non-parametric modeling in Python. Specifically, I will introduce Gaussian processes (GP), and show how they can be applied to regression analysis using a few examples.
